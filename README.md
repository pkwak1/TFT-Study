The code in here is to ensure some versioning in git. <br />
These visualizations should be run in jupyter (I use jovian). <br />
(Also, use your own riot api key if you'd like to reference the same queries I use) <br />

## Avg Challenger Win Rate
https://jovian.ai/pkwak1/riot-api-test
Files referenced: riot-api-test.py

The question here is, do top players have a high 'win rate'? 
The hypothesis here is does it take a lot of firsts to reach high elo, or is it simply a lot of top 4 games? What effects does that have on the system?
I classify a win as a first place.

This is the overall average in challenger elo: 17.72% as of 11/24

This is the top 20 win rates in challenger elo, win rate with respect to win loss percentage as of 11/24
